## About the Project

This project was completed as part of the online course "The Odin Project" and was made to practice skills that have been learned so far.
The skills showcased in this project are the use of ES6 modules and utilising Webpack.
The project mimics tabbed browsing but only uses one HTML file by using a module for each "webpage"
that is dynamically changed by the buttons in the nav bar.
